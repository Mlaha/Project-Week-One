# Project-Week-One
This is the week one project of the Data Science Bootcamp offered by LUX Academy.
Project question -" Let’s say you’re a Product Data Scientist at Instagram. How would you measure the success of the Instagram TV product?"

As a Product Data Scientist at Instagram, measuring the success of the Instagram TV (IGTV) product would involve a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics. The success of a product can be assessed using a variety of key performance indicators (KPIs) and other relevant data points.
Collecting some data about the performance of IGTV app such as views, likes, and comments for popular videos over time and used a database to store our findings.
I then used python programming language to to visualize our data. I rely on pandas for data analysis and used matplotlib to visualize our findings.
By visualizing the data, we can observe trends in video performance metrics over time. For example, we can see if there are any spikes in engagement on specific dates.
User Engagement-We begin by collecting some data about the performance of IGTV app such as views, likes, and comments for popular videos over time. This will enable us to asses user engagement on the content in the IGTV platform.
User Involvement-We would collect feedbacks through surveys to understand the satifaction of users on engaging with the platform.We would also analyze social media sentiments to gauge public perception of IGTV.
Ratings-We would implement a rating system for content quality and track the average ratings.Also measure the frequency of content reported for policy violations to ensure the platform's safety and integrity.Tracking adherence to content guidelines and community standards, as violations can negatively impact user trust and engagement.
Monitoring- Monitor IGTV's market share within the video-sharing and social media industry and assess its growth relative to competitors.
By analyzing these metrics and using data-driven insights,we can gain a comprehensive view of the success of the IGTV product and make informed decisions to drive its growth and improvement. Success can be evaluated not only in terms of user engagement but also in achieving strategic business goals and maintaining a safe and positive user experience.
